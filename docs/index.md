# What is the NECN Succession Extension?

The NECN Succession extension was designed to provide total ecosystem accounting of Carbon and Nitrogen and to allow species to respond dynamically to a changing climate via establishment and growth.  NECN calculates how cohorts grow, reproduce, age, and die.  Dead biomass is tracked over time, divided into four pools:  surface wood, soil wood (dead coarse roots), surface litter (dead leaves), and soil litter (dead fine roots).  In addition, three principle soil pools:  fast (soil organic matter (SOM) 1), slow (SOM2), and passive (SOM3) are simulated, following the Century soil model.

# Features

- [x] Estimate Net Ecosystem Exchange.
- [x] Estimate Actual and Potential Evapotranspiration, Climatic Water Deficit, and Available Soil Water.
- [x] Estimate smoke emissions from wildfires and prescribed fires.
- [x] Species parameters input as CSV delimited files.
- [x] Estimate Soil Organic Carbon, Soil Nitrogen, Nitrogen fluxes
